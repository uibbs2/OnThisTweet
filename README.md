# OnThisTweet
OnThisDay from facebook ported to Tweeter: a bookmarklet to see your past tweets

Add it to the favourites toolbar of Firefox and will open your old tweets: same day, years in the past
Actually tested on Firefox 94 either under Windows 10 or Linux (Ubuntu Mate)
Trying to study how to let it work on Chrome, but seems like an extension is required
